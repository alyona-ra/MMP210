    <p>Hi. My name is Skye and yes, Iâ€™m a giraffe.</p>
    <p>I always wanted to be a ballet dancer, but thinking about my super long neck got me sucked into a black hole. Oh my, it was really bad there. <i>Just pull the slide bar to learn more.</i></p>
    <p>But one day, I decided to travel all the way to another side of the planet. I became a cup and finally the work for my neck was found.</p>
    <p><i>The End.</i></p>
